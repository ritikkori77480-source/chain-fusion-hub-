# Chain Fusion Hub

## 🧩 Project Description
Chain Fusion Hub is a lightweight decentralized registry for managing blockchain-based projects. It enables users to create project entries, update their details, and store information securely on the Ethereum blockchain. This serves as a foundational example for how project data can be maintained in a trustless environment.
